# MyLittleJob Frontend Developer Exercise

At MLJ we love working with people who have their own unique opinion and are not afraid of making decisions and then confidently presenting them.
This exercise is designed to give you the opportunity to do exactly that and be the best you possible.

The designated time window is roughly one work week. You decide how much or how little effort you put into it. 


## Minimum Technical Requirements

- fork this repo and work on the fork
- commit frequently and in a sensible manner
- the application should live completely in the browser, no server side code.
- it must work in the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) 
- mobile is not necessary, but a plus
- use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for rendering
- use [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) for state handling
- you are free to use any other tools that help you achieve your goal


## Minimum Feature Requirements

- create a small music browser app using the â€‹[Spotify Search Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/)
- required widgets
  - a text field to enter search terms
  - a list view that displays search results
    - each search result entry should show artist, title, album, date of release, and cover art whenever available
  - a field that shows the number of displayed results and the number of total results
- create a short readme file to document your priorities, the tools you used and why you used them
  
- feel free to add more features to improve the experience


## Hints

- don't stray too far from the minimum requirements, make them look&feel and work great
  - think about error handling, testing, browser navigation, maybe design options
- focus on your strongest abilities
  - we happily accept sub par application architecture if for example the user experience is amazing
  - if you want to focus on programming, we accept design templates or framework defaults, but you should announce it to not commit plagiarism
